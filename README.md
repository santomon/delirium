framework for my bachelor-thesis "Influence of Training DatasetResemblance to Stimulus Set onPrediction Accuracy of Brain Activity"

The root directory of this repository is the designated working directory of this project.
you will also have to clone the following repositories into this project:

Neural Taskonomy: <br>
https://github.com/santomon/NeuralTaskonomy | Link to the original

Various Computer Vision Models: <br>
https://github.com/santomon/astmt | Link to the original <br>
https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2 <br>






<br>
This project naturally has all dependencies of the repositories used.

The notebooks contain the execution. Inconveniently enough, 
different stages are in different notebooks. To use the plotting functions,
 the backend should be changed to "agg" instead of "pgf" and the save file name to ".png" instead of ".pgf"
